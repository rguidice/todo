## User Feedback Areas

Monitor these areas for user feedback to prioritize features:

1. **Workflow Gaps**: What tasks can't be represented?
2. **Speed Bottlenecks**: What feels slow or clunky?
3. **Missing Integrations**: What external tools would help?
4. **Customization Needs**: What can't be configured?
5. **Platform Needs**: Windows/Linux demand?

## Notes for AI Developers

When implementing future features:
- Maintain the fast, local-first philosophy
- Keep UI minimal and uncluttered
- Ensure all features are keyboard-accessible
- Preserve data in plain-text formats where possible
- Test with AI agent modifications to ensure code remains modifiable
- Keep animation delays configurable
- Don't break existing workflows when adding features
